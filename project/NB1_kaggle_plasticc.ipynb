    "PLAsTiCC is the Kaggle competition for LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope).  The telescope, under construction at a remote mountaintop in Peru, is designed to capture alltogether new data from the night skies. Specifically, LSST has the ability to capture the entire southern hemisphere every 4 nights in a manner that allows observation of single-occurrence events such as micro-lensing, novae, as well as periodic evnets such as eclipsing binaries. Aperiodic events are important because, for example, micro-lensing can be used to discover planets such as earth!\n",
    "\n",
    "One-time events are hard to catch - LSST will perform observation at a scale (quantity and resolution) that allows identifying many more such events.  Pretty cool stuff!\n"

    "a) Review the \"starter Kit\"   https://www.kaggle.com/michaelapers/the-plasticc-astronomy-starter-kit\n",
    "b) Follow the example     https://www.kaggle.com/michaelapers/the-plasticc-astronomy-classification-demo \n",
